## Disc golf mobile app for tracking rounds for yourself or with you and your friends.

This app, built in Blazor MAUI Hybrid and a little help from tailwind, came together to create a disc golf round tracker that
will allow you to track rounds between you or multiple others. Its a very lightweight simple app meant for personal use on my Android Device.

## Can I install this?

The answer is yes. The only things missing are the source files for various dropdowns in the app for finding the course.
I targeted this app for Android and Windows, so I will show you how to run via Windows. Hopefully soon I can get this on the 
Google Play Store.

Steps to install project:

- clone repo to machine
- open up solution in Visual Studio
- target Windows Machine in build

- run the project

## FAQ

-What if I run and it opens a window with a black screen?
A. This is a common occurence and am not sure of the issue. All that is needed to resolve this is to stop the build and rerun it.
